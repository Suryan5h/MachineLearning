What is linear regression?
A linear regression model explains a relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a straight line.
The independent variables are also known as predictor variables and the dependent variables are also known as outcome variables. It is widely used for prediction and forecasting.

What is Linearity?
Linearity is a property between a pair of variables, which determines whether their relationship can be represented as a line y=m*x+c where m is the slope and c is the intercept of the straight line.
It also exists between an output variable and a set of independent variables {x1,x2,x3,...,xn}
y = m1x1 + m2x2 + m3x3 + ... + mnxn

Benefits of Linear Model:
1. Linerity is easy to interpret
2. Linear mdoels are easy to train and use.
3. They are computationally efficient.
4. They are less accurate, but generalize the whole data much better.
